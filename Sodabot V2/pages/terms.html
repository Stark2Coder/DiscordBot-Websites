        <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
        <h2>Last updated: June 13th, 2021</h2>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the https://www.soda.bot website (the "Service") operated by Soda Development ("Soda", "us", "we", or "our").
        Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.
        By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>
    
        <h2>Availability and Accuracy</h2>
        <p>The materials provided by our Services may contain errors or inaccuracies. Soda does not warrant that any of the materials provided by its Services is accurate, current or complete.
        Soda, therefore, reserve the right to change or update any of the information or content provided by its Services without any prior notice.</p>
    

        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>Links contained within our Service may direct you to third-party websites or services that are not owned by Soda.
        Soda Development is not responsible for the contents of any such site. Use of any site that is not owned by Soda is at the user's own risk.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>Soda Development reserves the right to suspend or remove any users access to our Services under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever including but not limited to a breach of these Terms.

        The suspension or removal of users access shall not entitle users to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement, nor does it exempt the user from paying any applicable fees or prices.</p>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>Some of the features and Products provided by the Website are provided based on payment.
        The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of Products can be found on the relevant Product Page, located in our Store.
        The Website may employ the use of third parties to complete Purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.
        We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any Purchase at any time for whatever reasons we deem valid, including but not limited to Products being incorrectly labelled on their relevant Product Page or the suspected use of fraudulent and/or illegal payment methods.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Subscriptions allow you to receive Products continuously.
        Paid subscriptions begin on the day the first payment is received by Soda.
        To maintain Subscriptions, you are required to pay the recurring fee on time. Failure to do so may cause service interruptions or cancellation.</p>

        <h2>PayPal Future Payments</h2>
        <p>If you authorize PayPal to process future transactions, Soda Development will store an identification code linked to your PayPal account. This will authorize our Services to automatically process payments for future purchases or recurring instalments of past purchases.
        This token can be revoked at any time, either by contacting Soda or by changing the user settings offered by PayPal.</p>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Soda Development and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Services, or b) a breach of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Our Services are provided on an "AS IS" basis. Soda provide no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
        Furthermore, Soda does not warrant that its Services will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location, or that any errors or defects will be corrected.</p>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>In no event shall Soda Development nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any damages including without limitation: loss of profits, loss of data, or any other intangible losses, arising out of (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iii) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or data, whether based on warranty, contract, or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>At our sole discretion, we reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice before any new terms taking effect. What constitutes Soda will determine a material change at our sole discretion.
        By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.</p>
